# 90DaysOfDevOps

This repository is used to document my journey on becoming a DevOps Engineer. I will be starting this journey on the 1st June 2022. 

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources. 

The goal is to take 90 days, at least 1 hour each a day, to learn all the various aspects of "DevOps" & build the foundational knowledge. 

The quickest way to get in touch is going to be via Twitter, my handle is [@PranavBobde](https://twitter.com/PranavBobde)
