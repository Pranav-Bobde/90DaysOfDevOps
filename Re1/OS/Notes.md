- So the linux kernel is common in all - Just the GUI, icon packs, themes, apps, etc differs.
- Same for Android & Mac & IOS

Kernel

- Linux → linux
- MacOS → darwin
- POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) - Standard Def to be maintained by the UNIX based OSs

# Day 2 - 30 July, 2022

### Virtualisation
Physical Machine, VM, Containers
- PM: Require all the hardware resources to run (single instance)
- VM: Multiple instances from same hardware resources
- Containers: Why create whole VMs if you can just run the apps you need. (Provide all the environment for running your app)

### Hypervisors
- Type 1: 
  - a.k.a Bare Metal Hypervisors    
  - Worked on the bare metal directly
  - More efficient & performant
  - Maily used in Data Centers
  - Ex. VMWare ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, etc
- Type 2:
  - a.k.a Hosted Hypervisor
  - Work on top of the OS (Host OS)
  - Less efficient
  - Mainly used by consumers
  - Ex. Oracle Virtual Box, VMWare Workstation, QEMU, etc
