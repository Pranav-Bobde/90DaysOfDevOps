# Types Of IP Addresses
1. IPv4 - 32bits
    
    IP Addressing with default class subnet mask is called **Classfull Addressing**.
    
    IP Addressing with non default subnet masks to reduce IP Address depletion is called **Classless Addressing**.
    
    1. Class A 
        1. N.H.H.H
        2. Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0
        3. 0 - 127
    2. Class B
        1. N.N.H.H
        2. Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
        3. 128 - 191
    3. Class C
        1. N.N.N.H
        2. Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        3. 192 - 223
    4. Class D - **Multicasting**
        1. Used by routers for routing purposes
        2. 224 - 239
    5. Class E - **Future Use**
        1. 240 - 255
2. IPv6 - 128 bits
